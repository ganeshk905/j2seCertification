 - Java Ranch (javaranch.com) Discussion forum with heavy emphasis on Java certification topics. Many resources, including lists of resouces, and helpful people and useful discussions.

 - API, Tutorials. Remember these are key source documents for the folks writing the questions.
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/
("Current docs" are Java 10. They're better indexed, with a search feature, but have new API elements that might mislead you--or you can check the "Since" tag attached to newer aspects of the APIs).

 - Commercial study material (to which I contributed sample questions) available from Kaplan (among others, Java Ranch maintains a list of resources, including sample question pools) http://www.transcender.com/
